                        In general, children can go to preschool when they’re 4 years old, or in the year they turn 4. Some preschools in some states and territories also offer programs for 3-year-olds.</p>
                    
                       <p> Sometimes things can get in the way of children going to preschool. Play is a great way to support your child’s learning and development at home. You can encourage your child to try play activities that are like the activities they’d do at preschool – for example, playing with cardboard boxes, making a collage and reading together.

                            <p style="color:darkred">The most important years of learning begin at birth.The first three years of a child's life are critical for setting the foundation for language acquisition, socialization, and attitudes to learning. During the early years and especially during the first 3 to 5 years, humans are capable of absorbing a lot of information. The brain grows most rapidly in the early years. High quality and well trained teachers and preschools with developmentally-appropriate programmes can have a long-term effect on improving learning outcomes for children. The effects tend to be more marked for disadvantaged students i.e. children coming from impoverished backgrounds with very little or no access to healthy food, socialization, books and play resources.
